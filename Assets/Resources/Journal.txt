Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Empty

Dear Diary, 
My name is "Hero". Well, 
that's not really my name but 
everyone here calls me that.
I've heard that writing out one's feelings can help with stress but I don't even know how I feel right now...

Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Numb

Dear Diary, 
It's been hard  on me these past several days...or rather, years. I feel like I have no where to go. No direction to head towards anymore.
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Guilty

Dear Diary, 
It's me again.
Lately, I've been thinking about..everything. And, well, it's really...nevermind.
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Tired

Dear Diary, 
I'm back. It was a struggle to get out of bed but lately it seems like everyday is a struggle...

I've heard that time heals all wounds but I don't know how long I can wait...
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Lonely

Dear Diary, 
Lately, it's been hard for me to recall when I was around anyone. I mean, I have gone to visit the town in the past but I felt like an outsider. I wish I wasn't alone right now...

Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Anger

I don't understand!
Why was I the chosen one? I never asked for any of this. What purpose am I supposed to serve now that I finished the job? Why must I deal with the after effects all by myself? I'm so tired! 
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Frustrated

Dear Diary,
I just really don't know why I had to be chosen for this task. There are plenty of people in the world and yet I was chosen. Especially someone who isn't part of this world!
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Drained

Dear Diary,
I remembered reading all those books and watching those movies that made it seem like saving the world was easy. Hah, you know, when I was first given this task even I thought it would be easy. Maybe difficult but not too over-the-top or anything..but I was wrong. 

Oh, so terribly wrong...
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Listless

Dear Diary,
Life has been so...empty. I feel like a machine that moves according to routine and no end in sight. Sometimes I wonder when my gears will stop turning...
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Stressed

Dear Diary,
I feel like I stop at any point the memories will come pouring back and I feel like I'm drowning with no means of escaping. I say that I'm trying to get over it but am I actually trying my best or do I really want to succumb to these emotions. 

I don't know anymore.
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Sad

Dear Diary,
I usually don't want to think about my family and friends back home, but today I can't help it. I miss them. I wish I could go back. There's so, so many things I wish for, but how much can I really wish for?
|
Spring X Year X:
Mental Status: Weird

Dear Diary,
I feel...weird. Different from before. It's been more than I week since I've started doing this and trying to move on. I don't know. Life hasn't gotten any easier...but it also doesn't feel like the end of the world either. Figuratively and Literally. I don't know. Just...

I don't know.â€ƒ
